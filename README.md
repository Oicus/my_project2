# Basic Web Application Firewall (WAF) Example

## Description
This script provides a basic Web Application Firewall (WAF) functionality to detect and prevent SQL Injection and Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) attacks.

### Features:
1. **Attack Patterns**: 
   - `SQL_INJECTION_PATTERNS` and `XSS_PATTERNS` lists contain the basic patterns we are trying to detect. These patterns are used to identify SQL injection and XSS attacks.
2. **WAF Check Function**: 
   - The `waf_check` function examines incoming HTTP requests. It checks request parameters (`request.args`) and request body (`request.data`). If any attack pattern is detected, the request is rejected with a 403 Forbidden error.
3. **Pre-request Check**: 
   - The `@app.before_request` decorator runs the `waf_check` function before each request. This ensures that all incoming requests are inspected by the WAF.
4. **Simple Routes**:
   - The `index` and `data` routes provide basic web application functionality. The `data` route accepts POST requests and securely handles data.

## Usage

### 1. Save the Script:
Save the code to a file, for example, `waf_example.py`.

### 2. Run the Script:
To run the script, use the following command:

```sh
python waf_example.py
3. Test in Web Browser:
Open a web browser and go to http://127.0.0.1:5000/. To verify the WAF is working, try various attack patterns.

Test Examples
SQL Injection Test:
sh
http://127.0.0.1:5000/?param=select * from users
XSS Test:
sh
http://127.0.0.1:5000/?param=<script>alert('XSS')</script>
This example provides basic WAF functionality and can be extended with more advanced features. For example, detecting more complex attack patterns, IP-based blocking, session management, and more can be added.
